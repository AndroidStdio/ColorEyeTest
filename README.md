## About the game
Your task is to find the odd colored square in 30 seconds and advance through levels that are getting more and more difficult. Check you results against other players from all around the world and try to be the best!

In the classic game you have 30 seconds to pass as many levels as you can, while in the time trial mode you need to pass 10 levels as fast as you can. When you're stuck, you can redraw or halve the map, but beware: they cost you time! On the other hand, the more levels you do without help, the more bonus time you receive!

The results are automatically saved into the cloud so you can continue the game on a different device from where you left off.

#### Material Design Elements
* Navigation Drawer (creating the header item is much easier now)
* RecyclerView (better list management)
* SnackBar (modern toast message)
